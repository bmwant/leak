If you need to install specific version of package it is useful to know all available versions to have a choice.

Just run

```bash
leak <package_name>
# e.g.
leak pyramid
# show all available releases
leak django --all
```

and you will see releases and some useful statistic about package specified. It will show most recent version, most popular (with highest number of downloads) and some additional information.

### How to install

Install using pip

```bash
pip install leak

# or to make sure the proper interpreter is used
python -m pip install leak
```

or upgrade existing version

```bash
pip install --upgrade leak

# or with pip invoked as a module
python -m pip install --upgrade leak
leak --version
```

### Obtaining downloads data

It is possible to get downloads statistics for the target package by using third-party [pepy.tech](https://pepy.tech/) provider.
Create your own [API key](https://pepy.tech/pepy-api)(note that free one is a subject to some limitations) and configure it like shown below

```bash
# for the current shell session through the environment
export LEAK_API_KEY=<your_api_key>

# or store it within a configuration file
leak --set api-key=<your_api_key>
```

In case you are not interested in this data, and want to hide the warning displayed, run

```bash
leak --set show-downloads=false

# to enable it back once you have an api key
leak --set show-downloads=true
```
